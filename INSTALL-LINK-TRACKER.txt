WHAT IS LINK TRACKER

Link Tracker is a browser extension for Chrome and Brave. Its purpose
is to make it a bit easier to find links to ressources accessed by
your browser.

As of this writing, it reports .VTT and .M3U8 files accessed on any
page. If need be, it can be improved to detect more file types based
on user preferences.

HOW TO INSTALL LINK-TRACKER

* Open a browser window (Brave or Chrome)

* Go to the "Extensions" page

* Enable "Developer mode"
  - IMPORTANT: RELOAD the Extensions page after enabling Developer mode
  - NOTE: You can disable it again after the extension is installed

* Open the Finder, navigate to the folder containing "link-tracker.crx"

* From Finder, drag the CRX file onto the Extensions page in the browser
  - This should offer to install the extension, NOT save the file
    (This happens when you didn't reload after enabling Developer mode)

* Once installed, PIN the extension to the browser bar:

  - In the browser bar, click the Extensions button (shaped like a
    puzzle piece)
  - Locate "Link Tracker", and pin it (press the pin-shaped icon)
    NOTE: you can unpin the extension later if you prefer.

HOW TO USE LINK TRACKER

* Navigate to a web site of interest, for example:
  https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/ondemand/video/2054144/

* Start playing the video, and enable subtitles

* Notice the small counter on the extension button: it shows how many
  links of interest were found.
  NOTE: this number often changes as scripts on a page load more assets

* Click the extension button: this opens a pop-up window where links
  are shown.
